> *Perhaps the most important thing about Core Data is that it’s guaranteed to be there for all apps, on all of Apple’s platforms. This means you can use it regardless of your needs: maybe it’s for saving important data, maybe it’s just a cache of content you downloaded; it doesn’t matter, because Core Data will do a great job of managing it for you.*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Make it accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swift’s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.

* [x] Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as `.beginsWith`, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initializer.

* [x] Make `FilteredList` accept an array of `SortDescriptor` objects to get used in its fetch request.
